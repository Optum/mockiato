Project Description:
====================

Mockiato is designed for API virtualization. With Mockiato, you can virtualize REST APIs, SOAP services, and even message-based middleware such as ActiveMQ. You can generate realistic data for testing, and export it to JSON, XML, or CSV. In seconds, via an API call or using our web-based UI, you can setup virtual endpoints that simulate your production APIs. These virtual endpoints are ideal for testing, sandboxing, knowledge transfer, and driving rapid development.
